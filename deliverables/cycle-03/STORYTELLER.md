# STORYTELLER (cycle-03)

## Story spine
The concept factory is a dream forge: a place where ideas condense into matter, and imagination is a tangible fuel. Its machinery does not just manufacture objects; it manufactures possibilities.

## Visual metaphors
- Constellation conveyor: ideas travel as stars before becoming artifacts.
- Prism kilns: light refracts into material forms.
- Floating molds: shapes orbit a central forge, ready to be pulled into reality.
- Living blueprint grid: lines sketch themselves into new inventions.

## Atmosphere
Bright, curious, and expansive. The factory feels less industrial and more alchemical, as if the workshop is a planetarium for creation.

## Design cues
- Use airy gradients and luminous accents instead of heavy metal.
- Favor circular motion and orbiting elements to imply infinite combinations.
- Keep a central "engine core" to preserve the Mortal Engines identity.
