# STORYTELLER (Cycle 03)

## Creative thread
Refine the original Marioland-inspired bonsai into a cleaner, more reliable 3D print while keeping the playful silhouette. The updated model should feel smoother and more intentional, but still like a friendly, chunky hero prop from a game world.

## Visual and form cues
- Preserve the S-curve trunk and puffed canopy masses.
- Keep branches stout and connected with soft transitions.
- Maintain a clean pot profile with gentle taper.

## Printability focus
- Prefer continuous, fused volumes over fragile details.
- Use subtle surface texture that survives mesh QA and slicing.
- Avoid thin, dangling elements.
