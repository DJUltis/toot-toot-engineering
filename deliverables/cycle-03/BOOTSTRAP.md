# BOOTSTRAP (cycle-03)

## Prompt
- Source: human request after cycle-02 delivery
- Prompt: Create a fresh take on the imagery for the Mortal Engines concept factory so it feels more imagination-inspiring, emphasizing a factory that can make anything.

## Team composition
- Bootstrap
- Storyteller
- Orchestrator
- Core worker
- Image producer
- Reviewer
- Delivery packager
- Retrospective

## Objectives
- Reimagine the visual language of the concept factory to feel more open-ended, inventive, and magical.
- Produce updated primary artifacts under `deliverables/cycle-03/` that reflect the new imagery direction.
- Ensure final deliverables include a small Toot Toot Engineering logo appropriate for the media.

## Plan adjustments
- Add an image producer step to explore concept sketches or composited imagery if needed.

## Risks and assumptions
- The new imagery should still align with Mortal Engines tone while expanding the imagination arc.
- The concept factory can be represented without overcomplicating the primary deliverable.

## Next-cycle prompt options (choose one for cycle-04)
1. Build an illustrated process map showing how the concept factory turns prompts into artifacts.
2. Create a motion poster version of the reimagined concept factory scene.
3. Draft a short narrative script that could accompany a future animated explainer.

## Retrospective updates
- Recommendation: When shifting visual tone, document the new palette and motif shifts in the solution notes for faster reuse.
- Recommendation: Keep a minimal logo bug variant in each cycle to satisfy branding without cluttering the scene.
- Offer: I can implement these recommendations and reset the plan once a cycle-04 prompt is selected.
