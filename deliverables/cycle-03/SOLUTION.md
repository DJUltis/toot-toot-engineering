## Description
This fresh concept factory imagery reframes the workshop as an imagination forge. A luminous core anchors the scene while orbiting idea-forms, constellation conveyors, and a living blueprint grid suggest infinite creative combinations. The tone is bright and alchemical rather than heavy industrial, while still honoring the Mortal Engines spirit.

## Design notes
- Airy gradients and glowing rings replace heavy metal textures.
- Orbital motion motifs imply limitless configuration and invention.
- The central forge preserves the mechanical heart of the brand.
