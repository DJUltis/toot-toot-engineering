# SOLUTION (Cycle 03)

## Overview
This STL refines the Marioland-inspired bonsai by increasing voxel resolution and adding subtle trunk surface variation. The model remains a single fused solid to maximize printability.

## Improvements vs cycle-01
- Higher voxel resolution for smoother surfaces.
- Slight trunk texture wobble for a more organic look.
- Expanded canopy cluster for a softer silhouette.

## Print notes
- Recommended layer height: 0.2 mm or finer.
- Estimated minimum solid span: 0.80 mm.
- Validate in your slicer if you plan to scale down.
