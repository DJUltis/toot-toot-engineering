# STORYTELLER (cycle-04)

## Story spine
The concept factory is a living pipeline: a prompt arrives as raw ore, is refined through roles, and exits as a polished artifact. The map should feel like a guided tour through a creative engine that can manufacture anything.

## Narrative beats
1. Intake: prompts arrive as sparks or seeds.
2. Refinement: roles shape and test the idea.
3. Assembly: assets converge into a finished deliverable.
4. Release: the output leaves the factory for the world.

## Visual metaphors
- Conveyor of ideas moving between stations.
- Orbital nodes representing roles in the system.
- A central forge representing the core transformation.

## Tone
Clear, optimistic, and inventive. The map should read at a glance but reward closer inspection.
