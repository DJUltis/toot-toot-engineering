# REVIEW

## Summary
The tulip plate set and instruction materials satisfy the prompt. The crease map is simple and should be usable for a basic tulip model, though more detailed creases could improve shape fidelity.

## Checks
- STL files present and printable: pass (basic geometry, manifold boxes).
- Two-plate press concept: pass with note (bottom plate is flat).
- Illustrated instructions included: pass (two-page PDF with large panels).

## Findings
1) The bottom plate is flat; consider adding shallow grooves or registration features for more consistent embossing.
2) The tulip crease map uses a simplified petal guide; a more detailed map could improve the flower shape.

## Recommendation
Proceed to delivery as-is, or schedule a refinement pass to add a groove plate and additional tulip creases.
