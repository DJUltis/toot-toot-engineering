# BOOTSTRAP

## Prompt interpretation
Create a variant press-plate set for a different origami model: choose either a frog or tulip. The plates should pre-crease the paper so a child can follow a simple map and fold the model with minimal effort. Provide matching child-friendly illustrated instructions.

## Selected model
- Tulip (simple, classic, fewer complex reverse folds than a frog).

## Objectives
- Design top and bottom plates that impress a tulip crease map on square origami paper.
- Output printable, manifold STL files with safe emboss depth.
- Deliver kid-friendly instructions with illustrations and short guidance text.
- Document dimensions, tolerances, and print recommendations.

## Proposed team composition
- Bootstrap: interpret prompt and propose plan adjustments.
- Storyteller: shape the kid-friendly narrative and instruction voice.
- Orchestrator: formalize the plan and tracking assets.
- Core worker: model the plates and produce STL + instruction copy.
- Image producer: generate simple illustration assets.
- PDF assembler: compose instructions into a print-ready PDF.
- Reviewer: check STL validity and instruction clarity.
- Delivery packager: assemble final assets and update releases.
- Retrospective: recommend workflow improvements for next cycle.

## Recommended plan adjustments
- Add a small test strip STL for emboss depth validation (reusable across models).
- Use a two-page instruction PDF for larger, kid-friendly panels.
- Include a simple alignment frame or registration tabs if the tulip map needs tight symmetry.

## Risks and assumptions
- Assume standard origami paper is 150 mm square; document scaling.
- Tulip base may need a few more pre-creases than the crane map.
- Emboss depth should be shallow enough to avoid tearing.

## Primary deliverables for this cycle
- `deliverables/cycle-02/PLATES_TOP.stl`
- `deliverables/cycle-02/PLATES_BOTTOM.stl`
- `deliverables/cycle-02/INSTRUCTIONS.pdf`
- `deliverables/cycle-02/INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- `deliverables/cycle-02/ASSET_NOTES.md`

## Next-cycle prompts (human must choose one after this cycle completes)
1) Create a frog variant plate set with a playful jump-themed instruction story.
2) Add a snap-fit alignment frame and storage case for the tulip plates.
3) Build a classroom activity sheet that pairs tulip folding with a short lesson plan.


## Retrospective (post-cycle)
- Add a parametric CAD script for easy model swapping between tulip and frog.
- Introduce a shallow groove plate or registration pins for consistent emboss depth.
- Expand illustration set with a mascot character for extra kid appeal.

If you want, I can implement these retrospective improvements and reset the plan for the next cycle once you choose a prompt.
