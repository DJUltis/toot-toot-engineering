# BOOTSTRAP (cycle-02)

## Prompt
- Source: human selection from cycle-01 prompts
- Prompt: Create a short animated intro sequence using the SVG logo with timed narrative captions.

## Team composition
- Bootstrap
- Storyteller
- Orchestrator
- Core worker
- Reviewer
- Delivery packager
- Retrospective

## Objectives
- Produce a concise animated intro sequence built around the existing SVG logo.
- Define timed narrative captions that align with the visual beats.
- Ensure final deliverables include a small Toot Toot Engineering logo appropriate for the media.

## Plan adjustments
- Add an image producer step only if additional motion frames or raster outputs are required.

## Risks and assumptions
- Target playback environment supports inline SVG animation or a lightweight wrapper.
- Captions should remain short to avoid timing drift across platforms.

## Next-cycle prompt options (choose one for cycle-03)
1. Build a one-page brand portal showcasing the logo system, motion rules, and usage examples.
2. Produce a 5-second audio sting that matches the mechanical rhythm of the logo animation.
3. Create a set of social-ready thumbnails that pair the logo with campaign themes.

## Retrospective updates
- Recommendation: Add a short "export path" note to cycle solutions when HTML is used, to guide video or embed workflows.
- Recommendation: Keep captions to 12 characters or fewer for tight timing control.
- Offer: I can implement these recommendations and reset the plan once a cycle-03 prompt is selected.
