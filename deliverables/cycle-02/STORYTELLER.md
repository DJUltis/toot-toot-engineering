# STORYTELLER

## Central story thread
A cheerful tulip named Tula teaches kids to make a paper flower using a "magic garden map" pressed into the paper. The plates are the garden tools that help the flower bloom.

## Narrative tone
- Bright, friendly, and encouraging.
- Simple verbs and short sentences.
- Celebrate each fold as a "petal" or "leaf" step.

## Instruction framing
- Title: "Tula the Tulip and the Magic Garden Map"
- Tagline: "Press, fold, and bloom a paper flower."
- Each step: 1 short sentence + 1 clear picture + a big step number.

## Visual direction for illustrations
- Simple line art with a tiny tulip mascot in the corner.
- Map lines are light dashed lines.
- Active fold line is bold with a clear arrow.
- Use hands in 1-2 steps to show gentle pressing.

## Key beats to highlight
1) Press the plates to reveal the garden map.
2) Make the big triangle folds.
3) Form the tulip base.
4) Fold petals up.
5) Open the bloom and add the stem.
