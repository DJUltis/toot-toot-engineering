# STORYTELLER (cycle-02)

## Story spine
The intro begins with a hush of steam, then the machine wakes. Gears catch, pistons rise, and the workshop window brightens as the name locks into place. Each caption is a staccato beat: signal, motion, reveal.

## Caption beats
1. "Ignition."
2. "Craft in motion."
3. "Toot Toot Engineering."

## Timing notes
- 0.0–0.8s: Steam/ambient glow, no text.
- 0.8–2.0s: Caption 1 fades in with initial gear movement.
- 2.0–3.4s: Caption 2 replaces caption 1; piston amplitude increases.
- 3.4–5.0s: Caption 3 locks in with the full logo mark.

## Tone and atmosphere
Warm, cinematic, and rhythmic. Captions are brief, confident, and mechanical in cadence.
