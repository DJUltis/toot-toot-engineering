# SOLUTION (cycle-02)

## Primary output
- `deliverables/cycle-02/assets/intro-sequence.html`

## Description
The intro sequence is a 5-second looping HTML scene that frames the existing animated SVG logo and overlays three timed captions: "Ignition.", "Craft in motion.", and "Toot Toot Engineering.". Each caption fades in and out on a staggered delay to match the mechanical motion beats.

## Assets
- `deliverables/cycle-02/assets/toot-toot-logo.svg` (primary animated logo)
- `deliverables/cycle-02/assets/toot-toot-logo-small.svg` (logo bug for small placements)
- `deliverables/cycle-02/assets/intro-sequence.html` (timed caption wrapper)

## Timing notes
- 0.0–0.8s: ambient logo motion, no caption.
- 0.8–2.0s: "Ignition."
- 2.0–3.4s: "Craft in motion."
- 3.4–5.0s: "Toot Toot Engineering."
