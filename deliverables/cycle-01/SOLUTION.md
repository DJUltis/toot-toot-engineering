# SOLUTION (cycle-01)

## Primary output
- `deliverables/cycle-01/assets/toot-toot-logo.svg`

## Description
The logo is a cinematic 2:1 animated SVG depicting a mechanical workshop window: interlocking gears, a piston block, a whistle, steam plumes, and warm metallic finishes. Motion is driven by CSS keyframes for gear rotation, piston travel, and smoke/steam drift, keeping the mark alive without overwhelming the typography.

## Implementation notes
- Aspect ratio: 1200x600 viewBox for a cinematic frame.
- Animation: CSS keyframes embedded in the SVG for gear rotation, piston movement, and smoke/steam cycles.
- Typography: serif display pairing to emphasize the handcrafted, industrial tone.

## Small logo inclusion
- `deliverables/cycle-01/assets/toot-toot-logo-small.svg` is a scaled-down companion asset for small media placements.

## Source alignment
The cycle assets are based on the repository master logo file at `toot-toot-logo.svg`.
