# SOLUTION

## Overview
This cycle delivers an animated SVG mural of a time foundry where molten timelines pour into gearworks that forge memories. The composition emphasizes a wide cinematic frame with layered depth, dense industrial detail, and a clear foreground plaque reading “TOOT TOOT ENGINEERING.”

## Primary asset
- `deliverables/cycle-01/assets/time-foundry.svg`

## Implementation notes
- The mural uses layered groups for background hall, molten streams, gears, presses, storytelling props, and foreground typography.
- CSS keyframes drive slow gear rotation, molten flow drift, glow pulses on memory plates, and furnace flicker.
- Gears are defined as reusable symbols to reduce redundancy and keep the SVG manageable.

## Logo usage
A small Toot Toot Engineering logo is embedded as a foreground stamp via `toot-toot-logo.svg` to satisfy the delivery requirement.

## Suggested verification
- Open the SVG in a browser to confirm animation timing and text readability.
- Verify the relative logo path resolves in the intended viewing environment.
