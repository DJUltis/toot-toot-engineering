# REVIEW

## Findings
No issues found that block delivery.

## Notes
- The logo asset is copied into `deliverables/cycle-01/assets/` and referenced locally by the SVG.
- CSS animations use long loops and `transform-box: fill-box` to keep gear rotations centered.

## Testing gap
- The SVG has not been opened in a browser during this review; verify animation timing and text legibility.
