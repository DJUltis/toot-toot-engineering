# REVIEW

## Summary
The core assets exist and are internally consistent. The STL plates and instruction materials meet the prompt at a basic level, but there are a few improvement opportunities for clarity and emboss quality.

## Checks
- STL files present and printable: pass (basic geometry, manifold boxes).
- Two-plate press concept: pass with notes (bottom plate is flat).
- Illustrated instructions included: pass (single-page PDF with line art).

## Findings
1) The bottom plate is flat, so the crease depth may be shallow and less uniform than a complementary groove plate. Consider adding shallow grooves or registration pins for alignment.
2) The crease map uses only diagonals and the center cross. If the goal is a full bird base pre-crease, additional lines may be needed.
3) The PDF panels are small for young readers; a two-page layout with larger panels may improve usability.

## Recommendation
Proceed to delivery with these as known limitations, or schedule a minor refinement pass if higher emboss fidelity is required.
