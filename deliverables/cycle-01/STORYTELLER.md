# STORYTELLER (cycle-01)

## Core narrative
CompanionID is a pocket-sized companion that grows with you: a quiet, durable device that pairs with other companions to create trusted micro-communities, idles with playful utility when you're alone, and becomes a gentle platform for DIY curiosity. It is less a gadget and more a living badge of shared presence, designed to fit the spaces between people, places, and ideas.

## Story spine
- **Origin:** You carry a small device meant to be stable and dependable, even when networks and attention drift.
- **Meeting:** Two devices "meet" on purpose, trading a handshake that says, "We recognize each other and will keep a private channel open."
- **Belonging:** A whitelist becomes a small constellation of trusted nodes, sharing updates without needing a central hub.
- **Idle life:** When nothing is urgent, CompanionID chooses small, delightful functions that make time feel lighter.
- **Growth:** The device accepts "toot-prompts" as seeds for new behaviors, evolving without losing its core identity.

## Key tone and UX principles
- **Intentional:** Meetings are opt-in; pairing is ritual-like and simple.
- **Quietly alive:** Idle modes are gentle, not noisy; information is calm.
- **DIY-friendly:** There is always a place to attach a small experiment.
- **Trust-first:** Devices prioritize local, signed interactions over remote features.

## Narrative touchpoints for design
- Button labels and idle modes should reinforce "companion" rather than "tool."
- Meeting should feel like a small ceremony (soft LED, short haptic/buzzer).
- DIY port should be framed as "add a charm" rather than "wire a module."
- Mobile app copy should emphasize "tune your companion," not "configure your device."

## Suggested slogans (internal)
- "Carry a calm constellation."
- "Meet, idle, and grow."
- "A small companion that learns your rhythms."
