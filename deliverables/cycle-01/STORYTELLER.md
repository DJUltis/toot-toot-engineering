# STORYTELLER (cycle-01)

## Story spine
Toot Toot Engineering is a living engine house: gears breathe, pistons sigh, and steam carries the promise of motion. The logo is not a static mark; it is a miniature factory where craftsmanship and momentum meet.

## Visual metaphors
- Gears: collaboration, interdependence, and precision.
- Brass and copper: warmth of human labor and the glow of invention.
- Steam plumes: ideas rising, energy cycling.
- Train whistle and rails: direction, cadence, and forward drive.

## Motion notes
- Slow, confident gear rotation to suggest steady progress.
- Subtle piston movement to imply power under control.
- Soft smoke and steam pulses to humanize the machine.

## Tone and atmosphere
Warm, cinematic, and optimistic. The frame feels like a workshop window into a mythic engine, balancing mechanical detail with readable brand text.
