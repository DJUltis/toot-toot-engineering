# STORYTELLER

## Central story thread
A friendly little crane named Kiko teaches a child to "wake the paper" with gentle presses and folds. The plates are the "crane whisperers" that leave a map on the paper, and Kiko guides the child to follow the map step by step.

## Narrative tone
- Warm, encouraging, and playful.
- Short sentences with action verbs.
- Celebrate small wins: "You did it!" "Nice sharp fold!"

## Instruction framing
- Title: "Kiko the Crane and the Magic Map"
- Tagline: "Press, peek, and fold to help Kiko fly."
- Each step: 1 short sentence + 1 clear picture + a big step number.

## Visual direction for illustrations
- Simple line art with a friendly crane character in the corner of each step.
- The pre-creased lines are shown as light dotted or dashed lines.
- The active fold line is bold, with an arrow.
- Use hands in 2-3 steps to show gentle pressing.

## Key beats to highlight
1) "Wake the paper" by pressing in the plates.
2) Find the big triangle (first folds use the pre-creases).
3) Make the "kite" shape and flip it.
4) Pull the neck and tail.
5) Fold the wings and let Kiko fly.

## Copy samples
- "Slide the paper into the plates. Press gently. The map appears!"
- "Fold along the bold line. Smooth it with your finger."
- "Open the wings. Kiko can fly!"
