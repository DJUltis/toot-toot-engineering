# STORYTELLER

## Central story thread
A vast time foundry refines molten timelines into memory artifacts. Rivers of glowing chronology pour from overhead conduits into interlocked gears that stamp and temper memories. The machinery is alive with purpose: each gear tooth is a moment, each rotation a life lived. The foreground inscription, “Toot Toot Engineering,” anchors the viewer as the proud maker of this impossible factory.

## Environmental storytelling cues
- A wall of stamped memory plates, some cracked or imperfect, hints at lost timelines.
- A suspended “calibration gauge” reads in eras (e.g., “Age 03:42”) rather than minutes.
- A small maintenance gantry with lanterns and tools suggests unseen workers.
- A spill of cooled timeline metal forms a fossil-like swirl, implying past failures.
- Subtle warning placards: “KEEP HANDS CLEAR OF REMEMBRANCE PRESS.”

## Scene composition guidance
- Wide cinematic ratio: emphasize horizontal flow of molten timelines across the frame.
- Establish three depth layers: background foundry hall, midground gears/presses, foreground inscription.
- Center-stage foreground text with a clear negative space to ensure legibility.
- Use converging piping and rails to guide the eye toward the central gears.

## Motion beats
- Molten timelines drift downward in slow, viscous streams.
- Gears rotate at different speeds; largest gear slow, smaller gears faster.
- Memory plates pulse or glow as they are stamped.
- Light flicker from furnaces for atmospheric movement.

## Tone and palette
- Warm molten cores (amber/orange) contrasted with cool steel blues/greens.
- High density detail, but with readable silhouette of the main gear assembly.
- Slight haze or heat shimmer near the molten pour.

## Text treatment
- “Toot Toot Engineering” appears as an engraved placard or metal marquee in the foreground, with subtle glow or rim light to separate it from the busy scene.
