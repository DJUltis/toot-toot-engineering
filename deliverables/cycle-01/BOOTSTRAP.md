# BOOTSTRAP (cycle-01)

## Prompt
- Source: `README.md`
- Prompt: Create a beautiful, colorful, animated Toot Toot Engineering logo in SVG with CSS and named "toot-toot-logo.svg". Use the Mortal Engines framework for inspiration and include as much detail and metaphoric imagery as we can possibly do. Make the aspect ratio super cinematic.

## Team composition
- Bootstrap
- Storyteller
- Orchestrator
- Core worker
- Reviewer
- Delivery packager
- Retrospective

## Objectives
- Confirm or enhance the animated SVG logo in `toot-toot-logo.svg` with cinematic aspect ratio and rich mechanical imagery.
- Produce cycle-01 deliverables under `deliverables/cycle-01/`, including a solution writeup and any required assets.
- Ensure final deliverables include a small Toot Toot Engineering logo appropriate for the media.

## Plan adjustments
- None; proceed with the existing critical path.

## Risks and assumptions
- SVG animations render consistently in modern browsers; note any caveats in delivery notes.
- The existing logo assets can be reused if they satisfy the prompt requirements.

## Next-cycle prompt options (choose one for cycle-02)
1. Expand the logo system into a full brand kit: color palette, typography pairings, and usage guidelines.
2. Create a short animated intro sequence using the SVG logo with timed narrative captions.
3. Design a simplified monochrome "stamp" variant of the logo for engraving or embossing.

## Retrospective updates
- Recommendation: Add a lightweight "logo bug" checklist item to ensure small-logo packaging is always captured in delivery assets.
- Recommendation: When a logo is already present in the repo, copy it into the cycle assets to keep deliverables self-contained.
- Offer: I can implement these recommendations and reset the plan once a cycle-02 prompt is selected.
