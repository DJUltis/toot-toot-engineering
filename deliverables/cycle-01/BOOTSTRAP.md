# BOOTSTRAP

## Prompt interpretation
Create a wide, cinematic animated SVG mural of a “time foundry” where molten timelines pour into gears forging memories, with subtle environmental storytelling. The foreground center stage includes the text “Toot Toot Engineering.” High visual density, narrative detail, and motion are required.

## Team composition
- Storyteller: refine the narrative beats and environmental storytelling cues.
- SVG engineer: define animation approach, SVG constraints, and motion plan.
- Orchestrator: finalize critical path, artifacts, and logging updates.
- Core worker: build the animated SVG mural and supporting assets.
- Reviewer: verify spec compliance, animation behavior, and density/readability.
- Delivery packager: assemble deliverables, logo usage, and release notes.
- Retrospective: capture improvements for next cycle.

## High-level objectives
- Deliver a single, animated SVG mural with cinematic framing and dense detail.
- Convey molten timeline flows into gears that forge memory artifacts.
- Ensure central foreground text reads “Toot Toot Engineering.”
- Embed subtle storytelling via background props, signage, or vignettes.
- Keep SVG performant, layered, and editable for iteration.

## Recommended plan adjustments
- Add an explicit “animation storyboard” note in the SVG engineer step for timing/looping.
- Ensure the core worker outputs the primary SVG at `deliverables/cycle-01/assets/time-foundry.svg` with a small Toot Toot Engineering logo integrated or companion.
- Add a lightweight “render check” step (manual open in browser) within the reviewer’s scope.

## Risks and mitigations
- Risk: animation overload reduces readability. Mitigation: staggered, slow loops and grouped motion layers.
- Risk: text legibility in dense foreground. Mitigation: reserve a clear focal zone and contrast paneling.
- Risk: SVG performance with high density. Mitigation: reuse symbols, gradients, and minimal filters.

## Retrospective recommendations (to apply at cycle end)
- Tighten the handoff between Storyteller and SVG engineer with a shared “scene map” artifact.
- Require a brief animation timing table to avoid conflicting motion.
- Add a standard SVG performance checklist before delivery packaging.

I can implement these recommendations and reset the plan with a new prompt grounded in the final deliverables when the cycle completes.

## Next-cycle prompt options (choose one)
1) Forge a companion SVG mural that zooms inside a single gear, revealing a microcosm memory archive with kinetic light trails and annotated time stamps.
2) Design a “maintenance bay” sequel scene where engineers tune the time foundry, with diagnostic holograms and a calm, contemplative mood.
3) Create a monochrome blueprint-style animated SVG that documents the time foundry’s mechanisms with callouts and subtle moving overlays.

## Retrospective update (cycle complete)
- The SVG pipeline produced a single animated mural with local logo asset inclusion; keep this pattern as the default for SVG-only cycles.
- Add a standard "local asset copy" step to avoid fragile relative paths.
- Introduce a lightweight visual QA pass before delivery packaging (open the SVG once in a browser).

I can apply these adjustments and reset the plan for the next cycle once you select a prompt option.
