## Dimensions
- Plate size: 150 mm x 150 mm x 3 mm
- Ridge height (top plate): 0.6 mm
- Ridge box size: 1.2 mm (dotted line style)
- Margin from edges: 10 mm

## Print recommendations
- Material: PLA or PETG
- Layer height: 0.2 mm
- 3 perimeters, 15-20% infill
- Print the top plate with ridges facing up.
- Print the bottom plate flat side up for even pressure.

## Usage notes
- Use gentle, even pressure to avoid tearing.
- If the paper tears, reduce pressure or use slightly thicker paper.
- To scale for other paper sizes, scale the STL uniformly.

## Pattern notes
- The current crease map includes the two diagonals and the center cross.
- Add additional lines later if you want deeper pre-creases for a bird base.
