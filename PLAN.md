- [x] 3. Orchestrator bootstraps the repo and sets the plan (cycle-01).
- [x] 4. Core worker produces primary solution assets (cycle-01).
- [x] 5. Image producer generates illustration assets. (`deliverables/cycle-01/IMAGE_ASSETS.md`)
- [x] 6. PDF assembler builds print-ready instructions. (`deliverables/cycle-01/PRINT_PDF.md`)
- [x] 7. Reviewer checks for correctness and gaps (cycle-01).
- [x] 8. Delivery packager assembles final assets and export notes (cycle-01).
